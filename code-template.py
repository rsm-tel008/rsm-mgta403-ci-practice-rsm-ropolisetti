# Code template for GitHub CI practice
# Read the text and code comments below carefully so you know what to do
# Step 1: After cloning this repo, uncomment line 19 below, save, stage, commit, and push
# Step 2: After check error messages on GitHub, uncomment line 15 below, save, stage, commit, and push

x = 3
y = 7

print(x + y)

# If you submit (push) this code file to GitHub as-is you will receive an email with error messages. Is there something missing? Yes! The variable `z` is not defined in this code file. After reading the message from GitHub, go ahead and fix the code in this file, but **not** before. Specifically, make sure you have defined the variable `z` as the sum of `x` and `y`. When you have made the change, push all changes to the GitHub server a second time. If all goes well, you should not receive any more error messages.

##### Step 2 #####
# Before pushing to GitHub the second time, define z = x + y by uncommenting the line below
# z = x + y

##### Step 1 #####
# Un-comment the line below before you push to GitHub the first time
print(z)
